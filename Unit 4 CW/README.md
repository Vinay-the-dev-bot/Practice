## Project Planning

This project was assigned to us at the beginning of our construction week. After analyzing the project requirements, each team member took responsibility for designing the layouts and functionality of each sections that were assigned to each member. We worked independently on our assigned tasks and created daily branches to commit and push our work. Collaboration was smooth, and at the end, we merged the final work into the main branch, successfully completing the project.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to our project mentor, Sir Pavan Ambulkar, for providing guidance and support throughout the project.
